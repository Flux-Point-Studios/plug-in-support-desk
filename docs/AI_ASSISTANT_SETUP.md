# AI Assistant Setup for Agent Creation

This document explains how to set up and use the AI assistant feature that helps users generate agent configurations based on their business description.

## Overview

The AI assistant helps users by:
- Generating professional agent names
- Creating concise agent bios
- Writing detailed agent descriptions
- Allowing regeneration of individual fields
- Supporting manual editing of all generated content

## Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
# AI Service Configuration (Flux Point Studios API)
VITE_AGENT_API_URL=https://api.fluxpointstudios.com/chat
VITE_AGENT_API_KEY=your_flux_point_api_key

# Alternative: Use OpenAI API
# VITE_AGENT_API_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
# VITE_AGENT_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## API Integration Details

The AI service is configured to work with the [Flux Point Studios API](https://api.fluxpointstudios.com/docs). Key features:

- **Session ID**: Automatically uses the user's email (if logged in) or wallet address (if connected)
- **Authentication**: Uses `api-key` header for authentication
- **Request Format**: Sends `message` and `session_id` parameters only
- **Response Format**: Reads AI response from `reply` field

## Features

### 1. Business Description Prompt
Users describe their business in a text area:
- Company type and industry
- Main products or services
- Target audience
- Support needs

### 2. One-Click Generation
The "Generate Agent Configuration" button creates:
- **Agent Name**: Concise, professional name (max 3 words)
- **Agent Bio**: Brief expertise description (max 100 chars)
- **Detailed Description**: Comprehensive agent personality and capabilities (2-3 paragraphs)

### 3. Field Regeneration
Each field has a "Regenerate" button that:
- Creates a new suggestion for that specific field
- Maintains context from other fields
- Uses slightly higher temperature for variety

### 4. Manual Editing
All generated content is fully editable:
- Users can modify any part of the suggestions
- Combine AI suggestions with manual input
- No restrictions on customization

## Implementation Details

### AI Service (`src/lib/ai-service.ts`)

```typescript
// Main generation function
generateAgentConfig({ businessPrompt }): Promise<AgentSuggestions>

// Individual field regeneration
regenerateField(field, businessPrompt, currentValues): Promise<string>
```

### UI Integration
- Business prompt textarea with placeholder examples
- Loading states with spinning icons
- Success/error toast notifications
- Regenerate buttons appear only when field has content

### API Configuration
- Supports OpenAI and compatible APIs
- Configurable model selection
- Temperature settings for creativity
- Token limits for cost control

## Usage Flow

   ```
   "We're an e-commerce platform specializing in sustainable 
   fashion. We need help with order tracking, returns, and 
   product recommendations."
   ```

2. **Click Generate**
   - AI processes the description
   - Generates all three fields
   - Populates form automatically

3. **Review & Edit**

   - Manually edit as needed

4. **Create Agent**
   - Form validates all fields
   - Proceeds with agent creation
   - Registers with Masumi

## Example Output

**Business Prompt:**
> "Online learning platform for coding bootcamps with live mentorship"

**Generated Name:**
> "EduTech Assistant"

**Generated Bio:**
> "Expert in course enrollment, technical setup, and learning path guidance"

**Generated Description:**
> "I'm your dedicated learning companion at CodeCamp Academy. With deep knowledge of our curriculum, enrollment processes, and technical requirements, I'm here to ensure your educational journey is smooth and successful.

## Customization Options

### Model Selection
Change the model in `ai-service.ts`:
```typescript
model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo', // or 'gpt-4', 'claude-3', etc.
```

### Temperature Settings
Adjust creativity levels:
- Generation: 0.7 (balanced)
- Regeneration: 0.8 (more variety)

### Token Limits
Control response length:
- Name/Bio: 100 tokens
- Description: 300-500 tokens

## Security Considerations

- API keys stored in environment variables
- Never expose keys to client
- Rate limiting recommended
- Monitor API usage costs

## Troubleshooting

### "No API Key" Error
- Check `VITE_AGENT_API_KEY` is set
- Restart dev server after adding env vars

### Poor Quality Suggestions
- Provide more detailed business description
- Try regenerating individual fields
- Adjust temperature settings

### API Errors
- Verify API endpoint URL
- Check API key permissions
- Monitor rate limits
